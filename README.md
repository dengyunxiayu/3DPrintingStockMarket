More than 6,000 companies have 3D printing businesses in the world, and the listed fourteen companies (Group 14) owned about 20% of the total 3D printing market value (Wohlers reports) from 2017 to 2020 (Data of 2021 has not been published). In some diversified companies, such as GE and Siemens, 3D printing is also part of their business but not the main business. These diversified companies are not objects of this analysis because their market performance cannot represent the future trend of 3D printing industry.
